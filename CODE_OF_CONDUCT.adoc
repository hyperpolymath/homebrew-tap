== Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

== Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
* Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting

== Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

== Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

== Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* *GitHub*: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/homebrew-tap/issues[Open an issue] (for public matters)
* *Email*: conduct@hyperpolymath.dev (if available, for private matters)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

== Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

=== 1. Correction

*Community Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

*Consequence*: A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation. A public apology may be requested.

=== 2. Warning

*Community Impact*: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

*Consequence*: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

=== 3. Temporary Ban

*Community Impact*: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

*Consequence*: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

=== 4. Permanent Ban
