== Security Measures

This repository implements the following security practices:

=== Supply Chain Security

* All release artifacts verified with SHA256 checksums
* No HTTP URLs (HTTPS only)
* Dependabot enabled for dependency updates
* CodeQL and Semgrep scanning enabled

=== Repository Security

* Branch protection on main branch
* Required reviews for pull requests
* Signed commits encouraged

=== Package Verification

Before a package is added or updated:

. Source URL must be HTTPS
